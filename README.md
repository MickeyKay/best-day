# In the best version of this day, I would. . .

## 08/17/15
* Save a life
* Build something used by thousands
* Create a new solution
* Wake up excited about what I'm building
* Call it quits at 4pm and have plenty of time for exercise and decompressing
* Feel undistracted by computer stuff as the evening rolls around
